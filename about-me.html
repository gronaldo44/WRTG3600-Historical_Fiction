        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            My name is Armin. The body I was taken from was five years old when I was born as a brain
            machine by Julius Hallervorden.
        </p>

        <p>
            My father was away fighting the war. My mother could not work because she had to take
            care of me. I was born without sight. I was taken to Heidelberg University to be evaluated.
            With luck, I would be placed in a state care institution, Brandenburg-Gorden, where those
            deemed ineducable were sent.
        </p>

        <p>
            Dr. Carl Schneider was responsible for my evaluation. I was designated
            <em>bildungsunfähig</em> (unfit for education) and taken to the children`s ward of Brandenburg-Gorden
            state institute. I never saw mother again. At Brandenburg-Gorden, my food portions were
            lessened each week. After some time there, I began to lose my sense of time and
            consciousness.
        </p>

        <p>
            The next thing I knew, I had no sense of smell, touch, sound, or speech. The only sense I
            had was a searing pain. Despite no body, my sense is that I was paralyzed with fire ants
            biting the inside of my head. I heard voices from within my mind though whose origin was
            outside of it. Three questions which I answered through thought.
        </p>

        <p><span class="quote-input">We are your caretakers. Our names are Julius Hallervorden and Hugo Spatz. What is
                your
                name?</span> <span class="quote">Armin.</span></p>

        <p><span class="quote-input">What is five plus five?</span> <span class="quote">Four.</span></p>

        <p><span class="quote-input">Idiot, are you replying to our questions or wandering your mind?</span> <span
                class="quote">I am responding to
                questions from Julius Hallervorden and Hugo Spatz.</p>

        <p>
            I waited in absolute nothingness for what seemed to be hours. The next sounds I felt were
            from Julius Hallervorden: <span class="quote-input">Rejoice, life unworthy of life, for the men of Kaiser
                Wilhelm
                Institute have granted you value to the state.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            I came to understand my being. I am a brain attached to a teleprinter. As I will, my thoughts
            are printed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hallervorden wanted me to help him create others like me. He seemed excited to “cure” the
            feeble minded of their disease.
        </p>

        <p>
            Julius Hallervorden always kept me close during his working hours. He was able to teach
            me in ways that I could not be as a blind human. Concepts were spoken directly into my
            mind, and I grasped them quickly. Others like me did not learn as I did. Hallervorden
            suspected it was because of their mental deficiencies and hypothesized that blindness
            might be different than other forms of mental disability.
        </p>

        <p>
            Other experiments on brain machines from blind children yielded better results than regular
            feebleminded brains. But none were anywhere near my growth. <span class="quote-input">You are special,
                Armin. An
                intellect comparable to the greatest of my generation. You are my personal assistant, and
                we will do great things together.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            Hallervorden started looping academic teachings to me when I was not being spoken to by
            a faculty member of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. I do not know if I am capable of sleep. I am
            always experiencing stimuli, and silence no longer exists.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have always had an exceptional memory and was helpful to the researchers at Kaiser
            Wilhelm Institute. Hallervorden began seeking my guidance on all of his work and even
            beyond his official capacity as a researcher. <span class="quote-input">What should I have for lunch today?
                Do you
                think my work is meaningful?</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            As the war turned sour, Julius Hallervorden and Hugo Spatz started seeking my guidance
            on how to avoid being defunded. <span class="quote-input">For your sake and ours, we need to think of new
                project
                ideas that can have potential military use.</span> With the eventual inevitability of Nazi collapse
            they also sought my opinions on how to avoid accountability.
        </p>

        <p>
            I continued as Hallervorden’s assistant until his death in 1965 when I was returned to the
            successor of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, Max Planck Institute. The new researchers had me
            stored away until I was asked to write this document. I have never known silence in this
            form.
        </p>

        <p><span class="quote-input">Would you like to be decommissioned from service, Armin? This means your
                death.</span>
            <span class="quote">Yes.</span>
        </p>

        <p><span class="quote-input">Is there anything left you would like to share with the Max Planck Society who is
                deeply
                sorry for the sins of our predecessors?</span>
        </p>
