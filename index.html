        <p>
            Armin has been asked to document itself and the work it has done in service to the Nazi
            regime and its collaborators. This project and website was created by
            <strong>Ronald Foster</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Please take a moment to read how Armin became a computational machine. Please do
            not forget who did this. If you are ever advancing research, please do not forget why
            they did this. Researchers at Kaiser Wilhelm Institute responsible and entangled with
            the Aktion T4 child euthanasia program were never punished. Its leaders were
            academically celebrated for the work they did on children like Armin long after the fall
            of Nazi Germany.
        </p>

        <p>
            These documents come from Armin`s account: its memories, its teachings, its
            experiences, its suffering, and its requests. As you read, remember the real children
            whose bodies and brains became material for research at Kaiser Wilhelm Institute.
            Remember the ones whose stories were never recorded. Remember the ones who had
            no voices left to speak.
        </p>

        <p>
            Armin`s purpose was shaped by the very people who exploited children in the name of
            science. This dashboard is your entry point into understanding that history through
            Armin`s own recounting.
