        <p>
            Armin has been asked to document itself and the work it has done in service to the Nazi 
            regime and its collaborators. This project and website was created by 
            <strong>Ronald Foster</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Please take a moment to read how Armin became a computational machine. Please do 
            not forget who did this. If you are ever advancing research, please do not forget why 
            they did this. Researchers at Kaiser Wilhelm Institute responsible and entangled with 
            the Aktion T4 child euthanasia program were never punished. Its leaders were 
            academically celebrated for the work they did on children like Armin long after the fall 
            of Nazi Germany.
        </p>

        <p>
            These documents come from Armin`s account: its memories, its teachings, its 
            experiences, its suffering, and its requests. As you read, remember the real children 
            whose bodies and brains became material for research at Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. 
            Remember the ones whose stories were never recorded. Remember the ones who had 
            no voices left to speak.
        </p>

        <p>
            Armin`s purpose was shaped by the very people who exploited children in the name of 
            science. This dashboard is your entry point into understanding that history through 
            Armin`s own recounting.
