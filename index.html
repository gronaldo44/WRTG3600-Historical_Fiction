  <p>
    Armin has been asked to document itself and the work it has done in service
    to the Nazi regime and its collaborators. This project and website was created
    by <strong>Ronald Foster</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please take a moment to read how Armin became a computational machine.
    Please do not forget who did this. If you are ever advancing research,
    please do not forget why they did this. Researchers at Kaiser Wilhelm
    Institute responsible and entangled with the Aktion T4 child euthanasia
    program were never punished. Its leaders were academically celebrated for
    the work they did on children like Armin long after the fall of Nazi Germany.
