<p>
    Dr. Carl Schneider was arrested for his crimes involving sorting children from the Aktion T4
    euthanasia program into death groups. He committed suicide by hanging while awaiting
    trial for his crimes in 1946.
</p>

<p>
    At Heidelberg University, Schneider conducted studies on psychiatric patients and
    children. He was part of the group responsible for selecting subjects to be killed, whose
    brains would then be studied afterward.
</p>

<p>
    Schneider was described as a kind and caring doctor at first. He wished to improve the
    wellbeing of his mentally deficient patients and encouraged his assistants to spend time
    with the patients outside of operations. The Nazi regime is said to have corrupted
    Schneider and repurposed his understanding of patients into cold sorting.
