<h2>Kaiser Wilhelm Institute - Hans Nachtsheim</h2>

<p>
  Hans Nachtsheim was never prosecuted and died peacefully in 1979.
</p>

<p>
  Served as head of the Experimental Hereditary Pathology department at the Kaiser Wilhelm
  Institute for Anthropology, Human Heredity and Eugenics (KWI-A) from 1941 to 1945. He
  was elevated as acting director of KWI-A in 1943.
</p>

<p>
  Hans Nachtsheim`s work for KWI-A involved exploring hereditary diseases in animals.
  He would try to replicate his experiments` findings on animals in children from the Aktion T4
  euthanasia program. Though none of the children have been found to have died directly
  from his experiments, it is notable that of the children known to be experimented on by
  Nachtsheim, only one survived the Nazi regime.
