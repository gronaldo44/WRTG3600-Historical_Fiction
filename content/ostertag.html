<h3>Berthold Ostertag`s Unusual Character and Honorifics</h3>

<p>
    Berthold Ostertag did not come from humble beginnings as he hailed from a bourgeois lineage.
    A brown shirt for Adolf Hitler`s early ascension to power, Ostertag notably leveraged his
    position as a brown shirt and WWI veteran to have a Jewish superior removed from his
    position, which was then assumed by Ostertag.
</p>

<p>
    Ostertag was likely driven more by a desire to climb the metaphorical career ladder than
    antisemitism. He later defended Jewish colleagues to their enormous benefit out of spite
    for his superiors.
</p>

<p>
    Ostertag was officially denazified in 1950 and went on to establish and head the
    Neuropathological Laboratory at the University of Neurology Clinic in Tübingen.
</p>

<p>
    Berthold Ostertag retired and was awarded the Grand Federal Cross of Merit in 1964.
