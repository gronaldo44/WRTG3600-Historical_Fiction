<h2>Kaiser Wilhelm Institute</h2>

<p><strong>August 1941</strong></p>

<p>
    Julius Hallervorden and Hugo Spatz introduced themselves then asked me for my name.
    My name is Armin, I wish to reply. I do not hear anything. It is as if the words are from within
    my own head but whose origin is outside of my mind. I do not speak but the next words
    make it clear that I am heard.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="quote-input">What is five plus five?</span>
    I did not know the answer but replied anyways: <span class="quote">Four.</span>
</p>

<p>
    They asked me one more question:
    <span class="quote-input">Idiot, are you replying to our questions or wandering your mind?</span>
</p>

<p>
    This is proof to me that my idiocy has not been cured. <span class="quote">I am responding to questions from
        Julius Hallervorden and Hugo Spatz.</span> Hours of nothing followed.
</p>

<p>
    Julius Hallervorden was next to communicate with me.
    <span class="quote-input">Rejoice, life unworthy of life, for the men of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute have granted you
        value
        to the state.
        You will work with us to create more like you.</span>
</p>

<p>
    Hans Nachtsheim and Berthold Ostertag had preserved the life of my brain in an artificial
    machine. Hallervorden, head of the Neuropathology department, and Spatz, director of the
    Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, had granted mind to this brain. This was my purpose — a high
    calling for a blind uneducable.
</p>

<p>
    Each week, 8-9 brains would be delivered to Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. Roughly 3 brains
    would live inside of brain machines. Each of these brains were nameless. They were
    identified by a condition that enrolled them in the Aktion T4 euthanasia program, age, town
    of origin, and race.
</p>

<p>
    For several months, there were few other successes. Most could recite their name. Some
    could answer the math question which I failed. None were given as much attention by
    Hallervorden as I had. Any who failed the sentience test were marked for other
    departments` experiments and discarded.
</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>January 1942</strong></p>

<p>
    The war effort diverted all research funding to military advancements only. Our director,
    Hugo Spatz, presented me to SS official Dr. Max de Crinis as argument for further funding.
    Granting ungodly life to life unworthy of life was impressive to Dr. Crinis, but he considered
    it a peacetime endeavor. Spatz was allowed to continue funding Julius Hallervorden`s research;
    however, the brains must be used militarily.
</p>

<p>
    Our next major research project was Organic Computation for Ballistics and Cryptography.
    This biomechanical machine would be able to predict firing tables, solve equations for
    rocket trajectories, and assist cryptologists in pattern permutations better than the Zuse Z3,
    because brain machines do not rely on preprogrammed instructions.
</p>

<p>
    It was simple to get adult brain machines to predict firing tables, but none were faster than
    a preprogrammed machine. A brain machine was still deemed more effort than it was
    worth to take onto a battlefield. The limitation was clear: we needed more computational
    power.
</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>March 1943</strong></p>

<p>
    The nation shifted to Total War and increased funding for superweapons. The increased
    funding allowed us at Kaiser Wilhelm Institute to pursue our dream project: combining
    multiple brains into one machine. In theory, this would improve our computational capacity.
</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>October 1943</strong></p>

<p>
    The first flickers of success began to ignite. When asked for their name, there was brain
    activity but no legible response from the teleprinter. The brain experienced a seizure and
    died. Hans Nachtsheim was impressed and began experiments on living children with
    epilepsy from Brandenburg-Gorden, intentionally inducing seizures. Nachtsheim sought to
    better understand seizures and found that rabbits could experience them as well.
</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>May 1944</strong></p>

<p>
    Bombing raids on the Reich capital forced Julius Hallervorden`s department to relocate to
    Dillenburg (Hesse). This relocation halted all forward progress. Funding and organic
    material continued to flow into the project, but Hallervorden and Spatz were not optimistic
    about delivering the Reich its superweapon. This safer location and continued funding were
    thanks to Hugo Spatz`s ongoing relationship with SS official Dr. Max de Crinis. Efforts were
    diverted into securing post-war positions without disrupting their current arrangements.
</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>May 1945</strong></p>

<p>
    Soviet forces took command of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. The war in Europe ended
    within the week before the Soviets had an opportunity to ransack the institution’s research.
    An investigation and subsequent trial of Nazi officials was conducted. The Allies deemed the
    Kaiser Wilhelm Institute a legitimate research establishment on the mentally deficient.
    Its principal staff, including Hallervorden and Spatz — who had sourced brains from the
    Aktion T4 program — were spared prosecution.
</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>February 1948</strong></p>

<p>
    Kaiser Wilhelm Institute was rebranded to the Max Planck Society under the West German
    government.
</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Late 1949</strong></p>

<p>
    Hugo Spatz and Julius Hallervorden were transferred back to the Max Planck Society and
    continued their research using leftover brain machines. Work moved slowly because they
    were careful not to destroy their now limited supply of organic material.
</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>December 1955</strong></p>

<p>
    Max Planck Society successfully created the first brain machine powered by multiple
    brains. When asked for its name, it responded:
    <span class="quote-us">Us.</span>
</p>

<p>
    In response to a logic question, it answered immediately and correctly.
    When asked who it was responding to, it replied:
    <span class="quote-us">We answer the questions and aid the research of Max Planck Society employees.</span>
</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>1956-1959</strong></p>

<p>
    Julius Hallervorden retired in 1956, and Hugo Spatz retired in 1959. Both continued working
    at the institute afterward in lighter roles.
</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>May 1965</strong></p>

<p>
    Julius Hallervorden died. Hugo Spatz arranged my archival as a historical artifact and
    trophy of the Max Planck Society`s achievements.
