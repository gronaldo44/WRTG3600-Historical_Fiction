<p>
  Julius Hallervorden was never prosecuted and died peacefully in 1965.
</p>

<p>
  Served as head of the Neuropathology Department for the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for
  Brain Research (KWI-B) from January 1938 until 1956.
</p>

<p>
  Credited via himself in an interview as the person responsible for entangling
  neuropathological research in Germany and the Aktion T4 euthanasia program.
</p>

<blockquote>
  “I heard that this was going to be done, so I approached them and told them, 
  `Look here now, boys. If you are going to kill all these people, at least take out their brains 
  so that the material could be utilized.` They asked me, `How many can you examine?` 
  and I said an unlimited number. `The more, the better.’”

<p>
  During the early stages of the Aktion T4 euthanasia program in 1938, Julius Hallervorden
  often served as a member of boards responsible for choosing which children would be
  marked for sterilization (to be killed). Later, in 1940, the program would expand to include
  adults after Hallervorden was no longer involved in the sorting criteria.
</p>

<p>
  Along with Hugo Spatz, Julius Hallervorden was responsible for supplying brains from the
  euthanasia program to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute.
