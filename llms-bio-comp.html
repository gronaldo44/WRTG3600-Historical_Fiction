    <h2>LLMs and Biological Computing</h2>

    <p><strong>2000</strong></p>
    <p>
      Using web crawling technology, researchers at Max Planck Institute begin work on making
      the multi-brain machine, Us, crawl the internet to understand and use its collective
      information.
    </p>

    <p><strong>2006</strong></p>
    <p>
      Cloud computing has become commercially available. Max Planck Institute begins work on
      a project to use the multi-brain machine, Us, as the backend for an intelligence assistant.
    </p>

    <p><strong>2007</strong></p>
    <p>
      The project evolves into a smartphone application that takes in voice or text input and
      outputs a response from the machine. The technology is dubbed a large language model
      (LLM) and is only possible via the thinking patterns of a brain.
    </p>

    <p><strong>2010</strong></p>
    <p>
      Us launches as a standalone open source application on the world wide web and mobile
      devices. It is quickly adopted as part of the workflow for all thinking jobs. Schoolwork,
      secretary work, creative writing, and engineering work are just some of the fields that begin
      to see transformations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ethical concerns about the multi-brain ignite scrutiny on Max Planck Institute’s prior
      associations with the Nazi regime. Single brain machines are reinspected out of respect for
      the victims of the Aktion T4 euthanasia program. The machines live in constant pain and ask
      the researchers for decommission. Because Us no longer has a personality or ties to its
      humanity, it continues to function. Skeptics claim Us also wanted to be decommissioned
      but was kept because of its potential.
